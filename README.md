# University of Helsinki's Fullstack Open 2024 
Standalone repository for part 3.

## Part 3 - Programming a server with NodeJS and Express

> In this part our focus shifts towards the backend, that is, towards implementing functionality on the server side of the stack. We will implement a simple REST API in Node.js by using the Express library, and the application's data will be stored in a MongoDB database. At the end of this part, we will deploy our application to the internet.

### Exercises focus:

Build a REST backend for the frontend UI 'Phonebook' built in the previous parts.
